# Image SMS

Image SMS uses long text SMS to send a very small picture (NOT MMS). It uses
base64 technique (similar to email attachments) to transfer data. It is
a bare metal App and Open Source on github. If you
want to enlarge the features, you have to do it by your own.

## Permissions

I love my privacy. Thus I love apps with only a couple of permissions. Image SMS only access on:

- SMS (read and send)
- Camera

Image SMS does not use access to:

- Files
- Contacts
- Internet

This may be strange to you, because you need a phone number and there is no contact selection.

## Get the App

[APK file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-go/ImageSms/master/app/release/click.dummer.imagesms.apk)

## NOT todo: CBC ciphertext stealing

THIS FEATURE MAKES SENSE, IF THE MESSAGE IS REALY LONG (filling random?).
There will be a small feature in the settings menu to use CBC ciphertext stealing and set initialvector and key.
